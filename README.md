ðŸ§­ Usecase Overview:

In the healthcare and pharmaceutical space, specialty and high-cost treatments (like oncology, rare diseases, and advanced biologics) require more than just a prescription. The patient journey from prescription to actual therapy initiation is often long, fragmented, and full of friction.

Even after a doctor prescribes the treatment, patients frequently encounter:

Insurance prior authorizations and denials

High out-of-pocket costs or co-pay hurdles

Long wait times for specialty pharmacy approvals

Lack of clear guidance or follow-up support

These issues often cause patients to delay, abandon, or never start their much-needed treatments. This is especially critical for specialty medications, where timely initiation is crucial to outcomes.

At the same time, support teamsâ€”like Access & Reimbursement Managers (ARMs), patient coordinators, and healthcare providersâ€”lack real-time visibility into these hurdles. They rely on static reports or delayed updates, making it hard to step in early when intervention matters most.

**Slide Title: Proactive Patient Interventions with Agentic AI**

---

**ðŸš© The Problem**
Patients often delay or drop out of treatment due to unclear or difficult therapy journeys. Manual tracking and reporting fail to detect early risk signals.

**ðŸŽ¯ The Goal**
Predict and prevent treatment withdrawal by identifying high-risk patients, HCPs, and payer-related barriers early to improve adherence and conversion.

**ðŸ¤– Why Agentic AI?**

* Monitors patient journeys autonomously in real time
* Flags potential risks like denial, delays, or dropout
* Suggests next-best actions to ARMs, managers, and HCPs
* Learns from micro-segmentation and behavioral patterns

**ðŸ’¡ Business Value**

* 30% faster Time to Therapy (TTF)
* 25% higher script-to-sale conversion
* Each 1% conversion gain = \$8â€“10M revenue impact
