## Overview
Welcome to our project submission for the Agentic AI incubation! This repository contains the code and documentation for our innovative solution. Our project aims in Patient Services Optimization:Exploring data-driven patient journey and providing actionable insights to address withdrwal rates and time to therapy.

In the healthcare and pharmaceutical space, specialty and high-cost treatments (like oncology, rare diseases, and advanced biologics) require more than just a prescription. The patient journey from prescription to actual therapy initiation is often long, fragmented, and full of friction.

Even after a doctor prescribes the treatment, patients frequently encounter:

Insurance prior authorizations and denials

High out-of-pocket costs or co-pay hurdles

Long wait times for specialty pharmacy approvals

Lack of clear guidance or follow-up support

These issues often cause patients to delay, abandon, or never start their much-needed treatments. This is especially critical for specialty medications, where timely initiation is crucial to outcomes.

At the same time, support teams—like Access & Reimbursement Managers (ARMs), patient coordinators, and healthcare providers—lack real-time visibility into these hurdles. They rely on static reports or delayed updates, making it hard to step in early when intervention matters most.

## Explanation
Our project leverages [mention any technologies, frameworks, or tools used] to create a [describe the type of solution, e.g., web application, mobile app, etc.]. The core functionality includes:
- **Feature 1**: [Briefly describe the first key feature]
- **Feature 2**: [Briefly describe the second key feature]
- **Feature 3**: [Briefly describe the third key feature]

## Intent
Predict and prevent treatment withdrawal by identifying high-risk patients, HCPs, and payer-related barriers early to improve adherence and conversion.

30% faster Time to Therapy (TTF)

25% higher script-to-sale conversion

Each 1% conversion gain = $8–10M revenue 


## Use Case
Assigned Industry Use Case:
Life Science:Proactive Identification of Interventions Framework	An Agentic AI framework that is a set of behavioral and digital interventions across the treatment journey strategically timed and orchestrated that could generate recovery of lost annual sales from leakage.
